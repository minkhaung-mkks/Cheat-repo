"# Cheat-repo" 
This is a file dedicated to tracking days where I did nothing for the whole day, but still pushed to keep my git history. I dont want to have too many of these so I'm keeping myself accountable with this file.

Day 1 : 06/06/2023 : Literally no reason just plain lazy
Day 2 : 13/06/2023 : Dont really know what to work on since I cant really test the app on my laptop.
Day 3 : 05/07/2023 : Not really feeling well today.
Day 4 : 06/07/2023 : Sick Day

Day 7 : 17/08/2023 : Still have nausea today, but not as bad as yesterday

Day 14 : 26/09/2023 : No electricity again today, It seems its going to be like this from now on till the next rainy season, I hope not but things are not looking good. I gonna try to find a time to work with the new electricity schedule but not really sure how to at all honestly.
